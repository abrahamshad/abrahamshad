1. **Transportation management software**: I wrote this custom software for a food distribution company.
All the information of more than 80 light and heavy vehicles are stored in it in the form of specific profiles for each vehicle and can be accessed only by the license plate number.
Another feature of this software is an alarm for replacing consumables based on the mileage of each car and periodic visits.
2. **Customer complaints management software**: In this software, all customers who contact the company and express their problems are recorded, and the support experts can easily check and solve the problems by referring and following up.
This software was custom analyzed and implemented for one of the clients with Python programming language and Django framework.
3. **Shadgram Rss Feed**: This Wordpress plugin fetches and displays posts from a specified Telegram Channel RSS feed.
